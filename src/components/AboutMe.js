                    <p className="description">
                        I am a finance professional who is very curious about technology.
                        <br /><br />
                        After graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with degrees in accounting and finance, I
                        began working in the mortgage industry in the Bay Area. With the huge tech exposure in Sillicon Valley, my
                        interest and curiousity in technology grew. I began reading and learning more and more about new technologies
                        and learning to code.
                        <br /><br />
                        With years of experience in the finance industry, I saw many inefficiencies. I began picking up classes in
                        Python and data science, followed by a full stack web dev bootcamp. I believe finance and accounting can do
                        better. At work, I collaborate with multiple internal and external parties to provide reports and analysis for senior management. I incorporate VBA and MySQL in these reports to greatly increase efficiency. Outside of work, I learned Javascript, MongoDB, Node.js, CSS, HTML, and Python. I want to keep growing so that I can have an impact in solving these inefficiencies.
